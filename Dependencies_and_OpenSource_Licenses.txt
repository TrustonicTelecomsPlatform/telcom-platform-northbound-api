Incase if want to keep this file in different location make sure to change path in build.gradle file to keep actual location.
3. Any IDE or tool for java coding.
4. Once code is compiled refer examples mentioned as methods and try to take that sample code and try to run like normal java program to see results.
5. Configure project.properties file in resources folder for base-folder, tenant_name and api_key properties.

Note:
Here every operation example is written as a method and this method takes input file from configuration path mentioned in project.properties. So first configure this file to run and see sample output.
